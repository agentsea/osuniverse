  value: "This is the diff between the markdown represenations of the original file and the edited file. The diff should contain the following: the 'Comparison to Other Flowers' section with the table that contains information about rose, sakura, sunflower, and tulip, related to colors, bloom season, and symbolism. It may also contain extra lines and page breaks. The change should be located at the end of the document, starting around the line 33 (the number may be slightly different, between 32 and 34)."
