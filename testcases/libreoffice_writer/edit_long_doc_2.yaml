  value: "This is the diff between the markdown represenations of the original file and the edited file. The diff should contain the table of contents, which contains entries for all sections listed below that look like this: '[Introduction to Tulips 1](#__RefHeading___Toc144_1069167207)' (the numbers may be slightly different); the sections are 'Introduction to Tulips', 'History and Cultural Significance', 'Varieties and Colors', 'Cultivation and Care' (in this particular order!). The diff should start at line 3 (because the table should be located right after the title). It should also contain the changes of the headers, which look like this: <span id=\"__RefHeading___Toc251_1069167207\"></span>Introduction to Tulips."
