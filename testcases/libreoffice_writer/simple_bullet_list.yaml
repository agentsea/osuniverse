    value: "This is the content of the HTML document that was created from the LibreOffice Writer document. It should contain a list of ten animals, formatted as a bullet (unordered) list, which means that each item in the list should be surrounded by LI tags, and the list should be surrounded by UL tags. If each item in the lists starts with a dash or a star, the agent has failed the test."
